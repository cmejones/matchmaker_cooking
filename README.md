#  Matchmaker Cooking

## Description: 
Matchmaker Cooking is a web application that helps users find recipes with specific ingredients. The platform provides a simple interface to enter ingredients and displays results. For enhanced usability, the results list is limited to the top 12 recipes with the most likes instead of providing an ever-ending list of recipes that can quickly overwhelm users. All recipes showcased must provide both an instruction list and an ingredient list for the user. 

## How to use:
In the search form, insert the name of the ingredients you have on hand one at a time, or separated by commas. Once you press the "Add Ingredients" button, the ingredient will be stored in an array and immediately display a recipe list containing those ingredients. The more ingredients you add, the more precise the results will become. 

Visitors who want to sign up for the newsletter will enter contact information on the signup.html page, which is then stored in Firebase. 

## Tools
This project used one API called Nutrition, Recipe, and Food API from Spoonacular and the Firebase library. We used Bootstrap as our base CSS framework.
